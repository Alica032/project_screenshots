## fullpage.js

Makes screenshots and saves the html of every url in config/urls_list.txt consecutively.
Warning: uses one page instance for all screenshots, so cookies and cache may influence the content of the screenshots.
Warning: uses png to store screenshots, and as we know, png encoding is a bit slow. Switch to jpg if it suits your needs.
Warning: html is obfuscated.

Run: ```node fullpage.js```
